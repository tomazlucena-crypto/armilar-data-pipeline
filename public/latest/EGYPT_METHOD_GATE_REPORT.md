| `sut_reference_period_matches_2021` | `CONTRADICTED` | `EGY_CAPMAS_SUT_2017_2018_METHOD` | `e5507609ee25f01fda1ae165fb8e416e2fe4802829739f4b3bc99b75b09ce69c` | The identified CAPMAS SUT benchmark is 2017/2018 rather than 2021. |
| `sut_is_exact_purpose_classification` | `CONTRADICTED` | `EGY_CAPMAS_SUT_2017_2018_METHOD` | `e5507609ee25f01fda1ae165fb8e416e2fe4802829739f4b3bc99b75b09ce69c` | The SUT is organised around products and activities, not twelve household purposes. |
| `hiecs_is_national_accounts_s14_p31` | `NOT_FOUND` | `EGY_CAPMAS_HIECS_2021` | `` | HIECS 2021 is explicitly a sample survey and cannot be substituted for national-accounts S14/P31. |
| `hiecs_reference_period_matches_2021` | `NOT_FOUND` | `EGY_CAPMAS_HIECS_2021` | `` | HIECS is a 2021 survey, but the matching year does not cure the conceptual mismatch. |
