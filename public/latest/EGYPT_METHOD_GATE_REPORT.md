| `machine_readable_catalogue_inventory_acquired` | `CONFIRMED` | `EGY_CAPMAS_NATIONAL_ACCOUNTS_EXPORT_CSV` | `dd4c1a3bcf31154dbfaabe65b60eb6f5a3be76fd6d9a6e36727981df1ab01eb9` | The official catalogue CSV inventory was acquired as machine-readable source-family evidence. |
| `sut_reference_period_matches_2021` | `CONTRADICTED` | `EGY_CAPMAS_SUT_2017_2018_METHOD` | `a3a74576d9fd75b5f05ddc256ec938801c15ea083757a8d8f62897b3f24be635` | The identified CAPMAS SUT benchmark is 2017/2018 rather than 2021. |
| `sut_is_exact_purpose_classification` | `CONTRADICTED` | `EGY_CAPMAS_SUT_2017_2018_METHOD` | `a3a74576d9fd75b5f05ddc256ec938801c15ea083757a8d8f62897b3f24be635` | The SUT is organised around products and activities, not twelve household purposes. |
| `hiecs_is_national_accounts_s14_p31` | `NOT_FOUND` | `EGY_CAPMAS_HIECS_2021` | `` | HIECS 2021 is explicitly a sample survey and cannot be substituted for national-accounts S14/P31. |
| `hiecs_reference_period_matches_2021` | `NOT_FOUND` | `EGY_CAPMAS_HIECS_2021` | `` | HIECS is a 2021 survey, but the matching year does not cure the conceptual mismatch. |
| `exact_armilar_source_available` | `NOT_FOUND` | `EGY_CAPMAS_NATIONAL_ACCOUNTS_CATALOG` | `7ec8ad1d027c69696c1b30deae1bf7b211a691d2d7d06a5293a7d0fc755a638c` | The catalogues, historical product-based SUT and 2021 survey each fail at least one exact Armilar gate; none supplies current-price 2021 S14/P31 by twelve purposes. |
